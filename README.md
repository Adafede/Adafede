Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Adriano. I'm a Natural Products researcher from Switzerland.

I am currently working on methodologies to improve the characterization of the composition of complex extracts from both qualitative and quantitative point of view. More precisely advanced LC-MS based metabolite profiling methods to assess phytochemical and sensorial profiles of plant extracts of industrial interest.
